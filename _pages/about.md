### About

I’m your workshop host, Emily Nava. I started my own writing business, [Tumbleweed Pioneer](https://tumbleweedpioneer.com/), in 2023. Since then I’ve led a number of prompts-based writing workshops. It’s a practice I feel passionate about because this writing method led to my own creative unblocking. I’ve written since I was a young child, but chose a career in the tech industry until I felt the pull grow stronger and stronger to commit to my creative calling. Now I work as a full-time writer, choosing the projects and clients that fulfill me. Prompts aren’t the only thing that contributed to my path, but they have been a huge part of it and I want to share the practice with others.

Through the process of working with my clients, I’ve developed a unique and inspiring way for people to start trusting themselves and their voice. And I am a firm believer that having more people in touch with their creative selves in this world is a great thing!
